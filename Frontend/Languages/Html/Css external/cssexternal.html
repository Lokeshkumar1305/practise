    <h1>EXTERNAL CSS</h1>
    <p>
      HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) are the fundamental web development languages. HTML defines a website’s content and structure, while CSS specifies the design and presentation. Together, both languages allow to create a website that is well-structured and functional.<br><br>
      CSS defines style declarations and applies them to HTML documents. There are three different ways to link CSS to HTML based on three different types of CSS styles:<br>

              . Inline uses the style attribute inside an HTML element<br>
              . Internal written in the <head> section of an HTML file<br>
              . External links an HTML document to an external CSS file<br><br>
    This article will focus on external CSS to an HTML file linking as it changes the appearance of your entire website with just one file. We’ll also include a more detailed explanation of CSS and its benefits.<br>

        <h2>How to Link CSS to HTML File Externally</h2><br>
        While there are multiple approaches linking CSS to an HTML file, the most efficient way is to link an external style sheet to an HTML document. It requires a separate document with a .css extension which solely contains all CSS rules without HTML tags.<br><br>

        Unlike internal and inline styles, this method changes many HTML pages by editing one CSS file. It saves time – there is no need to change each CSS property on every website’s HTML page.<br><br>

        Start linking style sheets to HTML files by creating an external CSS document using an HTML text editor and adding CSS rules. For instance, here are the style rules of example.css:<br>
