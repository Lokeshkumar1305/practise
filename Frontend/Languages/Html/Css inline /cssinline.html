     <P>
        Inline CSS is used to style a specific HTML element. For this CSS style, you’ll only need to add the style attribute to each HTML tag, without using selectors.<br>

       This CSS type is not really recommended, as each HTML tag needs to be styled individually. Managing your website may become too hard if you only use inline CSS.<br>

       However, inline CSS in HTML can be useful in some situations. For example, in cases where you don’t have access to CSS files or need to apply styles for a single element only.<br><br>
        1.Inline CSS is the technique to define the single element with the insert style sheets in an HTML document.<br>
        2.We can add CSS in three approaches: Inline, Internal, and External.<br>
        3.It has the interactive and unique style to create a single HTML element; we can define the inline CSS on the style attribute.
